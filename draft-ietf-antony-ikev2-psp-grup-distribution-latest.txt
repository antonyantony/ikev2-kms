           IKEv2 Scalable Group key distribution : PSP Group
            draft-ietf-antony-ikev2-psp-grup-distribution-01

Abstract


   This document explores and specify a symetric key distribution among
   members of large group via a Group Key Management server.  Group
   members use unique encryption keys to Here the group members
   communction is one to one.

1.  Introduction

   AI ML worker nodes that part of one group, and has group server which
   can authenticate these servers.  Each pair of nodes MUST use a unique
   pair of keys for ESP.  While the key s derived exchanging messages
   via group server.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC4301]:
   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP), Security Association (SA),
   Security Policy Database (SPD).

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC9347]: AGGFRAG
   tunnel.

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC7110]: Return
   Path Specified LSP Ping

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174]when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.1.  Why not each node directly

   If each node has to communicate directly every other node this would
   lead to each node have maintain N-1 connections for control traffic,
   i.e. IKE states, as well as the nodes would need it's identity, such
   as certificates.

4.  Operational Considerations

   Message scalability for large number of nodes in the group think of
   thousands to possibily millions of nodes.  Number of messages
   exchanges to derive unique key.

   ACKs TBD
